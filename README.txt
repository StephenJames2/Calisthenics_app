A mobile-first coach that builds personalized calisthenics plans from a short assessment, adapts to schedule (2â€“6 days/wk), and shows percent-progress toward big skills (e.g., muscle-up, planche, front lever, handstand push-up). Progress bars rise when you hit evidence-based milestones across primary and supporting qualities (pull, push/dip, core, technique, mobility), not just arbitrary badges.
